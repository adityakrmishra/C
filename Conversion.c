An Arithmetic operation between

int and int     ==> int
int and float   ==> float
float and float ==> float

5/2 --> 2               5.0/2 --> 2.5 //IMPORTANT!!
2/5 --> 0               2.0/5 --> 0.4 //IMPORTANT!!

NOTE:
int a = 3.5; //In this case, 3.5 (float) will be denoted to a 3 (int) because a cannot store floats.

float a = 8; // a will store 8.0 [8-->8.0(Promotion to float)]
